# Helper Scripts

This is a single script with multiple independent *helper* functions.

These functions are some ofthe more domain-general ones I use,for things like
file manipulation and IO.

I've been making the switch from Python 2 to Python 3, so most (if not all)
of the functions should work with Python 3 at this time (Nov. 15, 2015).
