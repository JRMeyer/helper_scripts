# Helper Scripts

A kind of miscellaneous repository.

* helper_functions.py, includes multiple independent *helper* functions. These functions are some of the more domain-general ones I use, for tasks like file manipulation and IO. I've been making the switch from Python 2 to Python 3, so most (if not all) of the functions should work with Python 3 at this time (Nov. 15, 2015).

* display_names.py, a little script that uses Tkinter to display names one by one from a list. The list is shuffled, and when all names have been displayed, the GUI closes. This script uses python2.
